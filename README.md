# Will customers purchase your product?

## ðŸ“Œ Project overview
A startup company that has just launched a new online shopping website wants to generate some insights into customer browsing behaviors in November and December, the busiest months for shoppers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Questions
- What are the purchase rates for online shopping sessions by customer type for November and December?
- What is the strongest correlation in total time spent among page types by returning customers in November and December?
- What is the likelihood of achieving at least 100 sales out of 500 online shopping sessions for the returning customers? If the rate of returning customers increases by 15%.

## ðŸ§© Results
The purchase rates by type of customer are:

- Returning customers: 19.6%
- New customers: 27.3%

The strongest correlation in total time spent among page types is between Administrative Duration and Product Related Duration.

Implementing a campaign that increases the rate by 15%, returning customers would have a **90% chance of achieving at least 100 sales in 500 sessions**.
